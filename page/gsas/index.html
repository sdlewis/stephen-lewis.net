							<h6>An Inverse Problem with Partial Data in an Infinite Slab</h6>
							by Kaloyan Marinov<br><br>
							
							Many inverse problems arise out of a PDE framework. The foundational hypothesis in the statement of an inverse 
							problem is the so-called <i>measurement data</i>. In many cases, the nature of the measurement data is mathematically encoded 
							in a linear operator between appropriately chosen vector spaces; an inverse problem can be studied when full measurement 
							data is available (corresponding to full knowledge of some linear operator) or when partial measurement data is available 
							(corresponding to limited knowledge of some linear operator). After one has decided upon the measurement data (to be taken 
							as a hypothesis in the analysis), there are three aspects of an inverse problem which one can choose to study: uniqueness, 
							stability, and reconstruction.<br><br>

							In this talk, we will consider an inverse problem associated with the Schrödinger operator $- \Delta + q$ on 
							an infinite slab $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, where $q$ is a compactly supported function from $L^\infty(\Sigma)$ 
							and $n \geq 3$. We will assume to have knowledge of partial measurement data. The discussion will then focus 
							on the uniqueness aspect of our inverse problem (due to [Li-Uhlmann]) as well as on its stability aspect (due
							to [Caro-M]).<br><br>

							<h6>Collisions of Competing Brownian Particles</h6>
							by <a href=" http://www.math.washington.edu/~ansa1989/">Andrey Sarantsev</a><br><br>
							Consider a finite system of Brownian particles on the real line, with each particle 
							having drift and diffusion coefficients depending on its current rank relative to other particles. A triple collision 
							occurs when three or more particles occupy the same position at the same time. We find a necessary 
							and sufficient condition for absence of triple collisions. We also investigate some other types of 
							collisions. This continues the work by Ichiba, Karatzas and Shkolnikov. <br><br>

							<h6>An Introduction to Probability in SAGE</h6>
							by <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~tadic/">Tvrtko Tadic</a><br><br>
							
							In the talk, we present a Sage package for doing symbolic 
							probability calculations. We will show how to build a (finite) probability space and define random variables on it. 
							Through examples, we will show how to manipulate those objects to check and find different results. There are many packages that 
							offer different possibilities for doing statistical computations and simulations.
							Unfortunately, there aren't as many packages with capabilities of doing various symbolic computations with a probabilistic model.
							We will go over the basic probability and Sage terminology that will be used in the talk.<br><br>

							This talk will focus on the nonlinear Schrodinger equations (NLS), a prototype for the nonlinear 
							dispersive equations. I will start by introducing some properties of the NLS: the local well-posedness 
							theory and conservation laws, the criticality of nonlinearity, and a special solution called the solution.
							Then I will focus on the characterization of solutions of NLS in different regimes.<br><br>

							<h6>$o$-minimality and $n$-to-$1$ Graphs in the Study of Electrical Networks</h6>
							by Reid Dale<br>
							
							<div class = "shortLong">
								<div class = "abstract">

									<div class = "container">
									<br>
									In this talk I propose that methods of a branch of mathematical logic called model theory serve 
									as a possible framework for studying discretized versions of continuous inverse problems. The 
									example I consider is that of the inverse problem on electrical networks studied in the last 
									25 years in Jim Morrow's REU. The basic setup of the problem is to model an electrical network 
									as a finite graph $G$ (with a partition of the vertices of  $G$ into interior and 
									boundary vertices $\mathring{G}$<!--$\overset\circ{G}$--> and $\partial G$) with conductivities on the edges and 
									currents flowing through the vertices as constrained by Kirchhoff's law, which intuitively 
									says that on interior vertices the current flowing into that vertex is equal to current flowing 
									out of that vertex. The inverse problem is to uniquely determine the conductivities of the 
									electrical network just by knowing the current flow at the boundaries and the structure of 
									the graph $G$. All of this information can be represented as a linear operator $\Lambda_{\gamma}$,
									called the response matrix of a conductivity function $\gamma$ that assigns to each 
									edge $e\in E_G$ in the graph a positive real number. The inverse problem can be therefore 
									reformulated: Given a matrix $\Lambda$ that we know to be the response matrix of some graph,
									can we uniquely find a conductivity $\gamma$ such that $\Lambda = \Lambda_{\gamma}$?<br><br>

									The first glimpse of model theory to study the problem was the discovery that the methods of real
									algebraic geometry could be used to study the phenomenon of $n$-to-$1$ graphs, which are electrical 
									networks with boundary data admitting exactly $n$ conductivities as solutions to the inverse problem.
									I associated to a given graph $G$ a measurement map $L_G: (\mathbb{R}^+)^{|E_G|} \to M_{|\partial G|}(\mathbb{R})$
									mapping a conductance $\gamma \mapsto \Lambda_{\gamma}$. A graph is then $n$-to-$1$ precisely when there is 
									a matrix $\Lambda \in M_{|\partial G|}(\mathbb{R})$ such that $|L_G^{-1}(\Lambda)| = n$. What is special about this
									measurement map $L_G$ is that it is a rational function between smooth manifolds. Using the machinery of real
									algebraic geometry I was able to show that associated to each graph was a finite set $\Psi_G$ of 
									cardinal numbers such that $G$ could be endowed with the structure of an $n$-to-$1$ graph. Furthermore,
									I showed that the only possible values for $n$ were finite numbers and the cardinality of the continuum,
									providing a negative solution to the question of whether or not a finite electrical network could be countable-to-one.<br><br>

									The use of more sophisticated tools from model theory has led to a much stronger refinement of this result to the 
									computable setting. In particular, one is able to computably list all of the numbers in the set $\Psi_G$ described 
									above. Furthermore, one can algorithmically partition the space of matrices $M_{|\partial G|}(\mathbb{R})$ into 
									finitely many nice sets called  ``cells" such that over each cell the map $L_G$ has the structure of a <i>fibration</i>
									map. Moreover, I show that if one is given a (suitably presentable) matrix $\Lambda$ then one can determine in finitely
									many steps how many solutions to the inverse problem it admits and, if this number is finite, computably approximate 
									all solutions to arbitrary precision and accuracy. Together these results answer in full generality
									many questions that students have worked on for the last two decades. Despite this, these results also indicate 
									how little we know about the problem and have been the source of many conjectures and questions that
									I hope will stimulate research in the area.<br><br>

							<h6>The Angular Derivative Problem</h6>
							by Nikolaos Karamanlis <br><br>
							The angular derivative problem is to give necessary and sufficient geometric conditions on
                            the boundary of a simply connected domain $\Omega$ near $\zeta\in \partial\Omega$ so that a conformal map 
							of $\Omega$ onto the upper half plane extends to be ``conformal'' at $\zeta$. It is an old problem dating back
                            at least to 1930. We will state some of the main results in the area and use them to examine
                            a question asked by Rodin and Warschawski. We will conclude with an open problem.<br><br>

							<h6>Free Boundary Regularity Below the Continuous Threshold</h6>
							by <a href="http://www.stephen-lewis.net">Stephen Lewis</a><br><br>
							
							Let $\Omega$ be a region in Euclidean space, and consider the energy functional 
                            $E(v) = \int_\Omega |\nabla v|^2 + Q^2 \chi_{\{v>0\}}$. We consider functions $u$ 
                            which are local minima of $E$, and ask two questions about them: how nice is $u$ 
                            and how nice is the boundary of the support of $u$, $\partial \{u>0\}$? <br><br>
                            Alt and Caffarelli address this question for functions $Q$ which are at least Holder 
                            continuous in small enough dimension by showing (among other things) that $u$ is harmonic
                            on the interior of its support and that the free boundary $\partial \{u>0\}$ is smooth 
                            and has one more derivative than $Q$. Central to their approach was the fact that in a 
                            small enough dimension, no singularities can arise. Applying techniques of minimal 
                            surfaces and an original monotonicity formula, Georg Weiss was able to give dimension
                            bounds on the singular set in higher dimensions.<br><br>
                            In this talk, we will summarize this and other work of free boundary regularity, 
                            and survey how one may be able to analyze the free boundary for $Q$ which is not continuous. 
                            In particular, we will give a new monotoncity formula in the case that $Q$ is of "Dini type mean oscillation,"
                            which need not be continuous.<br><br>

							<h6>On the Limiting Case of the Allard Regularity Theorem</h6>
							by Jessica Merhej<br><br>
				            The theory of rectifiability provides a measure theoretic 
                            notion of ``smoothness'' for surfaces which are not smooth in the usual sense. 
                            Rectifiable varifolds were introduced to provide the right framework to 
                            study minimal surfaces. Existence and regularity of rectifiable varifolds have 
                            been broadly studied in Geometric Measure Theory. Allard's regularity theorem 
                            is an outstanding result. It examines the question of regularity for a 
                            rectifiable n-dimensional varifold $M$ , if the generalized mean curvature 
                            of $M$ is bounded in $L^{p}$, for $p>n$.<br><br>
                            This talk is concerned with the critical exponent $n$. In particular, how regular 
                            will a rectifiable $n$-dimensional varifold $M$ be, if we only assume $L^{n}$ bounds on the generalized mean curvature of $M$?

							<h6>Market Models in Stochastic Finance</h6>

							Why is the Brownian motion so widely used in 
                            stochastic finance? We shall trace the history of 
                            this exciting area of applied mathematics, from 
                            the pioneering work of Bachelier (1900) to Samuelson model
                            of geometric Brownian motion to current models.

							<h6>Uniformly Distributed Measures are Locally Uniformly Rectifiable</h6>
							by Abdallah Dali Nimer<br><br>
							
							A uniformly distributed measure $m$ is a Radon measure such that for all $x$ in its support and for 
							all $r>0$, $m(B(x,r))=f(r)$, for some positive function $f$. If $f(r)=cr^n$, we say $m$ is $n$-uniform.<br><br>
							
							In a recent paper, X. Tolsa proved that $n$-uniform measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ are  uniformly 
                            rectifiable. In this presentation, I will start by presenting some background on this question. 
                            I will then show the main ideas involved in the proof of a more general local version of this result,
                            namely that uniformly distributed measures are locally uniformly rectifiable.

							<h6>Calderon's Problem and Complex Geometric Optics Solutions</h6>
							by Yang Yang <br><br>
							
							Calderon's problem, which is also known as the electrical impedance tomography problem, was 
							solved in 1987 for dimension $n \geq 3$ by Sylvester and Uhlmann using the complex geometric 
							optics (CGO) solutions. Since then, these special solutions have found their applications in a 
							wide range of inverse problems including inverse boundary problems, inverse scattering problems, 
							coupled-physics problems, etc. In this talk, we will demonstrate the construction of the CGO 
							solutions, and apply them to prove Calderon's problem for $n \geq 3$.

							<h6> Optimal Transport and Cyclical Monotonicity</h6>
							by <a href=" http:http://www.math.washington.edu/~wongting/">Leonard Wong</a><br><br>
							
							Suppose you control all oil mines and you know the demands of all cities. You also know the cost of 
							transporting oil from one location to another. Designing a transportation plan to minimize total cost
							 is a problem of optimal transport. Optimal transport theory arises in many areas from differential 
							 geometry to economics. After formulating the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem, we focus 
							 on a geometric property of transportation plans called cyclical monotonicty. Intuitively, a plan 
							 satisfies this property if it cannot be improved by any cyclical permutation. It is easy to show 
							 that any optimal solution must satisfy cyclical monotonicty, but the sufficiency is more difficult 
							 and requires some conditions to hold. We will present a recent new proof of the sufficiency by 
							 Mathias Beiglboeck (2014) which applies the ergodic theorem. This talk will be accessible to 
							 anyone with a general background in analysis.

							<h6> Mixing of the Noisy Voter Model</h6>
							by  Harishchandra Ramadas <br><br>
							
							The noisy voter model is a simple `interacting particle system' that can serve as a crude stochastic model 
							for the spread of opinions in a human population, or the competition for territory between two species. We 
							study the convergence to equilibrium ``mixing'' of this model, and show that this happens extremely fast -- 
							more precisely, on an arbitrary graph with n vertices, the model mixes in time of $O(\log n)$, for arbitrarily 
							small values of the ``noise parameter''. The talk will be accessible to non-Probabilists.<br><br>
                            Dominic Yeo has written a

							<h6>Two Families of Particles with Annihilation on a Membrane</h6>
							by  <a href="http://staff.washington.edu/louisfan/">Wai-Tong (Louis) Fan</a> <br><br>
							
							Mathematicians and scientists use interacting particle models to gain understanding of the emergence 
							of macroscopic phenomena from microscopic laws of nature. My talk will focus on an interacting particle 
							system which can model the transport of positive and negative charges in a solar cell. In this model, two 
							families of random walks in two adjacent domains annihilate each other on a deterministic interface.<br><br>

							Heuristically speaking, this could also be a model for population dynamics of two segregated species interacting at
							a static boundary. The goal of my project is to study the evolution of particles in space and time. I will discuss 
							the hydrodynamic limit and the fluctuation limit for the particle densities, that is, the behavior of the system at 
							two different scales. The two limits can be described, respectively, by a coupled partial differential equations 
							and a Gaussian process solving a stochastic partial differential equation. Other related models will be mentioned 
							at the end of the talk.<br>

							variation norm.  An <i>$L$-space</i> is a closed subspace $L$ of $\mathcal{M}$ which is closed under absolute continuity: 
							$\nu \ll \mu$ and $\mu \in L$ implies $\nu \in L.$<br><br>

							In this talk, we describe a generalization of Lebesgue decomposition to $L$-spaces, based on work of Host, 
							Mela and Parreau.  We then use the Radon-Nikodym theorem to give local representations of $\mathcal{M}$ in spaces of 
							integrable functions and its Banach space dual $\mathcal{M}^\ast$ in spaces of essentially bounded functions.  When $X$ 
							is a compact abelian group, $\mathcal{M}(X)$ forms a Banach algebra under convolution, and we use the preceding material 
							to give an interesting description of the Gelfand spectrum of $\mathcal{M}$ in terms of <i>generalized characters</i>,
							due to Sreider.   These give rise to an action on measure valued operator algebras on $X$, with a few interesting
							consequences.  In particular, we describe a power series like expansion on $\mathcal{M}$, and state a diagonalization result 
							for matrix-valued measures strong mixing with respect to endomorphisms of $X$, based on work of Queffelec.<br><br>

							<h6>Sets of Locally Finite Perimeter and Rectifiability of Their Reduced Boundary</h6>
							by Jessica Merhej<br><br>

							The theory of "<i>rectifiability of sets</i>" provides a measure theoretic notion of "smoothness" for surfaces 
							which are not smooth in the usual sense. A very important class of sets, to which we can apply our rectifiability 
							criterion is sets with "<i>locally finite perimeter</i>." On these sets, there exists a canonical Radon measure that 
							is supported on the boundary. Thus, we can get interesting information on what happens inside such boundaries. In this 
							talk, we will see that the boundary of a set of locally finite perimeter is rectifiable. We also give a necessary and 
							sufficient condition for sets to be of locally finite perimeter.<br><br>

							<h6>The Tensor Tomography Problem in Dimension Two</h6>
							by Yang Yang <br><br>

							In computerized tomography (CT), one concerns the recovery of a function from its integrals along geodesics. 
							Similar problems for symmetric tensor fields arise in various areas, which are known as the tensor tomography 
							problems. We will consider this problem in dimension $n=2$, and present an elegant proof of a geometric flavor 
							discovered by Paternain, Salo, and Uhlmann. <br><br>

							<h6>Increasing Stability Phenomena for the Schrödinger and the Diffusion Equations</h6>
							by Ru-Yu Lai<br><br>

							The problem of recovering potential in the Schrödinger equation from boundary measurements has been 
							studied since the 1980s. It is well known that the problem is ill-posed, that is, a logarithmic stability 
							estimate holds and is optimal. However, the logarithmic stability makes it difficult to design reliable 
							reconstruction algorithms in practice since small errors in the data of the inverse problem result in large 
							errors in the numerical reconstruction of physical properties of the medium. It has been observed numerically 
							that the stability increases if one increases the frequency in some cases. In this talk, I will introduce several 
							results which rigorously demonstrated the increasing stability behavior in different settings.<br><br>

							<h6>Analysis of Time-Like Graphical Models</h6>
							by <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~tadic/">Tvrtko Tadic</a><br><br>

							Modeling systems that involve uncertainty are often done using stochastic processes. Stochastic processes are a collection of
							random variables indexed by some set $T$.
							Classically, $T$ is a subset of (non-negative) real numbers and represents time. Recently, a lot of modeling has
							been done when the stochastic processes are indexed by vertices $V$, where the conditional dependencies are encoded 
							in the structure of the (directed or undirected) graph $G=(V,E)$. These are known as graphical models and have 
							become very popular in machine learning.
							<br><br>

							We present a new model that combines the features of the two mentioned
							models&mdash;processes indexed by a time-like graph. This is a continuous model
							indexed by a graph with a built in time structure.
							The model was introduced by Burdzy and Pal in 2011. Their model has strong
							restrictions on the degrees of vertices, the structure of the graph, and the
							distributions of processes defined on them.
							<br><br>

							During the talk we will give examples that illustrate these processes.
							New results that enable us to define a wider family of processes on a
							larger collection of graphs and new properties of the model induced by
							time and the graph structure will be presented.
							Connections to Markov random fields, the stochastic heat equation, as
							well as generalized classical Markov and martingale properties for
							some processes will be shown. We will conclude with a discussion of
							the structure properties of time-like graphs, including the
							presentation of the new algorithm that identifies the important
							subfamily of time-like graphs.

							<h6>Gromov-Hausdorff Limits of Metric Spaces</h6>
							by <a href="http://www.stephen-lewis.net">Stephen Lewis</a><br><br>

							For two metric spaces $X$ and $Y$, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance ${\rm D_{GH}}(X,Y)$ is a quantity which compares the 
							salient features of $X$ and $Y$ as metric spaces. In particular, ${\rm D_{GH}}(X,Y) = 0$ if and only if $\overline{X}$ is 
							isometric to $\overline{Y}$. Moreover, ${\rm D_{GH}}$ is a metric on isometry classes of bounded complete metric spaces. This will allow 
							us to define the limit of a sequence of uniformly bounded metric spaces $(X_i, d_i)$, or the limit of a sequence of
							(potentially unbounded) pointed metric spaces $(X_i, d_i, x_i)$. We use the latter to make sense of tangents to 
							metric spaces and give a survey of some work in this field.<br><br>

							A powerful method to study stochastic systems consisting of a large number of particles is the correlation 
							functions technique. We will demonstrate this by establishing the propagation of chaos result and the hydrodynamic 
							limit of some reaction-diffusion systems. These results provide us with the link connecting the microscopic behavior

							<h6>The Regularity of Loewner Curves</h6>
							by <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~tvhuy/">Huy Tran</a> <br><br>
							​The Loewner equation gives a one-to-one correspondence between growing slit curves in a domain and certain
							real-valued continuous functions called driving functions. C. Earle and A. Epstein (2001) showed that if the slit 
							curve is in $C^n$ (respectively real analytic) then the driving function is in $C^{n-1}$ (respectively real analytic). 
							Conversely, C. Wong (2012) showed that a $C^\beta$ driving function generates a $C^{\beta +1/2}$ curve for 
							$1/2 <\beta \leq 2$ except when $\beta = 3/2$.<br><br>

							In this talk, I will discuss new ideas to extend Wong's result for all $\beta>1/2$ 
							(except for when $\beta$ is a half-integer) and to show that real analytic driving functions generate real 
							analytic curves.<br><br>

							This is joint work with Joan Lind.

							Suppose we have a finite system of Brownian particles on the real line.
							They move as Brownian motions with drift and diffusion coefficients depending on their rank. 
							We say that they have triple collisions if, at a certain moment, at least three of them occupy the same
							position on the real line. This is a bad phenomenon, and we provide conditions when it does not happen. Some open problems will be presented.

							<h6>Uniform Measures and Uniform Rectifiability</h6>
							by Abdalla Dali Nimer <br><br>

							An $n$-uniform measure $\mu$  in $\mathbb{R}^d$  is a Radon measure such that for every $x$ 
							in its support, and every $r>0$,  $\mu (B(x,r)) = c r^n$. Although they are essential to many important results

							<h6> Infinite Games, Determinacy, and the Relative Continuum Hypothesis </h6>
							by Reid Dale <br><br>
							The study of subsets of the real line led Cantor to invent set theory 
							in the late 1800s, and his attempts to prove the continuum hypothesis 
							eventually led to the subject now known as descriptive set theory.
							Modern descriptive set theory has isolated the notion of infinite 
							games as the proper framework to understand many properties of 
							subsets of the real line–from perfection to measurability–and led 
							to a construction of a model of set theory in which every set of 
							real numbers is Lebesgue measurable under the assumption of an 
							axiom known as the Axiom of Determinacy AD.This talk will address
							the problem of the continuum hypothesis relative to sets with nice 
							topological properties: we will talk about the validity of the
							continuum hypothesis for closed, then Borel, and finally for projective sets.

							<h6>Pattern Avoiding Permutations 'Are' the Brownian Excursion</h6>
							by Erik Slivken <br><br>
							Permutations of size $n$ that avoid a particular pattern in $S_3$ can
							be counted by the $n^{\rm th}$ Catalan number.  Dyck paths of length
							$2n$ can also be counted by the $n^{\rm th}$ Catalan number.
							Naturally there exists bijections between the two sets.  Remarkably,
							given the right choice of bijection, both of these random objects
							converge (in some sense) to the same thing, a Brownian excursion.  The
							convergence to Brownian excursion helps answer all sorts of questions
							about the pattern avoiding permutation, like the number of fixed
							points of permutation.  This is joint work with Christopher Hoffman

							Portfolio managers invest their clients' money in stocks aiming to earn a higher return than that of the market (such as S&P500).
							In this talk, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to analyze the performance of any portfolio with respect to the 
							market index. It provides physical and geometric insights into when and why a strategy works, and we will see that relative 
							entropy plays a key role. We propose a large class of strategies that can be easily implemented and outperform the market
							under suitable conditions. This framework is also well-suited to analyze a hierarchical portfolio of portfolios. 
							The mathematics is elementary and a lot of examples and pictures will be given. This is joint work with Soumik Pal.

							The <b>October 10th</b> talk will exceptionally take place in <b>PDL C-36</b>. <br><br>

							Questions of existence and regularity of minimal "submanifolds"
							have been central to a classical problem in the calculus of variations. 
							Minimal submanifolds are characterized by the property that their mean curvature vanishes.
							Rectifiable varifolds are generalized submanifolds. In particular, a varifold is said to be stationary 
							if it admits zero mean curvature. A natural question in this area is whether one can get any sort of
							regularity on the varifold if the mean curvature is controlled in an integral sense. Allard's regularity 
							theorem states that with the correct bounds on the upper density of the measure, and the $L^{p}$ norm of the
							mean curvature, the varifold is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ submanifold.<br><br>
							This talk will be divided into two sessions. In the first session, we will give a motivation, 
							and a general overview of the subject, with the background needed to state and prove Allard's regularity theorem. 
							In the second session we will sketch the proof of Allard's regularity theorem.

							<h6>Local Set Approximation and Tangents of Arbitrary Sets</h6>

							We describe a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ as "smooth" if at 
							each point $x\in A$, there is a plane $T_xA$ which approximates
							$A$ arbitrarily well at small scales. However, in areas of math 
							such as variational analysis, geometric measure theory, and other
							non-smooth analyses, this setup won't give a complete picture.
							Often, it is useful to consider sets $A$ which are well 
							approximated at small scales by some general class of sets $\mathcal{S}$.
							This allows us to take tangents of non-smooth objects, and 
							investigate non-smooth situations such as real-algebraic varieties, 
							the support of Radon measures, and almost-minimal surfaces to name a few.<br><br>


							In this talk, we will give a framework of local set approximation and

							the CRT, and a potential path to a solution. Along the way, we apply Ahlfors's theory of quasiconformal maps to give

							<h6>Decoupling of Modes for the Elastic Wave Equation</h6>
							by Justin Tittlefitz</br>

							<p>We consider the elastic wave equation $u" = A(x,D)u; u = (u_1, \ldots,
							u_n)$. Elastic waves in isotropic media exhibit two modes of
							propagation; one where the displacement is in the direction of
							propagation (the $P$-mode) and one where displacement is orthogonal to
							propagation (the $S$-mode). By examining the orthogonal projections
							($\pi_P$ and $\pi_S$) onto these modes, one can effectively "diagonalize"
							the operator $A$, writing $A(x,D) = c_P^2(x) \Delta \pi_P + c_S^2(x)
							\Delta \pi_S +$ lower order terms ($c_P$ and $c_S$ correspond to the
							propagation speeds of the two modes). The question then arises: to
							what extent are these modes preserved throughout a wave's evolution?
							Specifically, for initial displacement $f$, if $\pi_S f = 0$, is $\pi_S u = 0$
							(or vice-versa) for all $t$ as well? If not, what can be said about this
							interaction?
							</p>

							<p>In this talk, we will discuss a result due to Brytik, deHoop, Smith
							and Uhlmann, showing that the $P \leftrightarrow S$ interaction is smoothing of
							degree 1. We will also cover some basic properties of
							pseudodifferential operators in order to understand this problem, and

							It is well known that Simple random walks in $\epsilon\, \mathbb{Z}^n$ converges to Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^n$ 
							(the Donsker's Invariance Principle in 1950's). Moreover, some local limit theorem holds, which tells us that the 
							convergence rate of the transition densities at any fixed point is about $\epsilon^n$. Do we have analogous result for 
							Reflected Brownian Motion? We will discuss these results and illustrates standard techniques in obtaining heat kernel estimates.

							is some bounded domain containing the support of $f$.

							This problem is relatively well-understood in acoustic media (i.e. for a scalar wave equation), but less is known about the 
							problem in elastic media. In this talk, I will discuss this case; specifically, we assume $u = (u_1,u_2,u_3)$ solves the elastic 
							wave equation 
							$$
								\partial_t^2u = \nabla \cdot \left( \mu(x) ((\nabla u) + (\nabla u)^T)\right) +

							different approximation strengths and approximating sets, have been proven in different areas, including minimal surface and

							This is achieved for reflecting process by taking a look at the local stationary process.  We'll present the so called Reflected

							In scientific research, people are often interested in the macroscopic evolution of a large (typically of the order of $10^{23}$) number of objects which are governed by some microscopic rules. Some typical examples are chemically reacting
							systems, the evolution of some thermodynamic characteristics of a fluid, population genetics, etc. The macroscopic evolutions are sometimes described by deterministic differential equations, called the hydrodynamic limits. e.g. For a large
							number of RBMs on a bounded Lipschitz domain, the hydrodynamic limit is the heat equation with Neumann boundary condition.

							see one or two concrete and easily stated results.

							<h6>An Inverse Source Problem in Radiative Transfer</h6>
							by <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~hubenjm/">Mark Hubenthal</a></br></br>

							We consider the radiative transfer equation, which governs the behavior of photons in a medium in the presence of some unknown source f. For a generic set of scattering and absorption coefficients, it is shown that the direct problem is well-posed. It is also known that the outgoing intensities of photons on the boundary of the domain uniquely determine f if the background absorption and scattering parameters are known a priori. This has applications in optical molecular imaging and radiation detection.

							<h6>Interacting Particle Systems, Free Boundaries, and Weak Solutions to a Non-Linear Parabolic Equation in the Unit Interval</h6>
							by Joel Barnes</br></br>

							I will talk about a differential equation from my research and (hopefully) prove a uniqueness result for weak solutions.  
							Along the way I will define the Stefan problem, discuss boundary conditions, and describe three isomorphic discrete Markov 
							Processes if time allows. Comfort in $L^2$ is the only prerequisite for the main portion of the talk.

							<h6>Reflecting Processes on Bounded Domains</h6>
							by <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~maduarte/">Mauricio Duarte</a></br></br>

							Reflecting processes are a natural object to study in bounded domains. In general, they behave as Brownian motion inside of 
							the domain and reflect instantaneously at the boundary in a given angle, which varies along the boundary. We'll focus on 
							describing the stationary distribution of such processes and will give a precise formula for its density in bounded planar 
							domains.

							<h6>Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus</h6>
							by <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~ansa1989/">Andrey Sarantsev</a></br></br>

							Brownian Motion is the most important process in the theory of continuous-time
							stochastic (=random) processes. This random function has amazing and very irregular behaviour; 
							e.g. it is continuous but nowhere differentiable and has infinite variation.
							Nevertheless, it is possible to develop differential and integral calculus for random functions related to this process.
							The main result is Ito's Change-of-Variable Formula; it shows that there are effects in stochastic calculus
							that do not have anything analogous in the classical calculus.

							<h6>Rectifiable Sets and the Besicovitch 1/2-conjecture</h6>
							by <a href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~badger/">Matt Badger</a></br></br>

							The Lebesgue density theorem says that for Lebesgue almost every point $x$ in a subset $A$ of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, 
							the density $\lim_{r\rightarrow 0} m(A\cap B(x,r))/r^n$ exists and is equal to $m(B(0,1))$. For lower dimensional 
							Hausdorff measures this result is typically false! This is exciting, because it means that using Hausdorff measures one can 
							see a variety of behaviors.  Rectifiable sets are those sets on which the density exists at almost every point.  
							The Besicovitch 1/2-conjecture is an outstanding 73-year old conjecture about rectifiable sets.
